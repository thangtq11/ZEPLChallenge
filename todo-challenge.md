Project description

Write a HTTP restful TODO service. This service will have an open api to let user manage his TODOs.

Topology
A Todo is a container of a list of Tasks. You can imagine a structure like this:
  - TODO
   - Task1
   - Task2
   - task3
   - etcetc 

Tasks

    You will have to find a nice way to organize and persist each todos and tasks. (If we restart the service we should be able to recover the list of todos and tasks)
    You need to handle eventual error with a proper HTTP status + error message.
    You need to log events
    We need to be able to start the service with different port. (provide a way to configure it)

    You will provide the following endpoint

        GET /todos Get a list of Todos

        Payload will look like this

        [
           {

              "created": "2016-12-07 05:42:29.809"
           }
        ]

        GET /todos/:todo_id/tasks Get todo tasks

Implementation instructions

For the fun, we want you to implement this challenge by using the following instructions.

    Java 8 (lambda, steam api etcetc).
    Guice for Dependency Injection.
    Jetty & JAX-RS for web framework.
    Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization.

Evaluation (in order of importance)

    Code organization (reusable code, good coding practice, project architecture)
    Completeness of the project
    Code readability
    Test coverage
